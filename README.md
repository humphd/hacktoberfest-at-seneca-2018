# Hacktoberfest 2018 at Seneca

Open Source students in OSD600 and DPS909 are participating in [Hacktoberfest 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) for their Release 0.2. This is our tracking repo, welcome!

## Weekly Summaries

- [Week 1](data/week01.md)

## Requirements and Instructions

During October 2018, students are required to complete **5 Pull Requests** to open source projects hosted on GitHub. Your final submission is due by October 31, 2018.

All course submissions are done in this repo's wiki. Students must update the
wiki with new Blog, Issue, and/or Pull Request links each Monday in October (see below).

### Tracking Issues, Pull Requests, Blog Posts

Every GitHub Issue and Pull Request you work on should get recorded in
the [Student Submissions wiki page](https://github.com/humphd/hacktoberfest-at-seneca-2018/wiki/Student-Submissions).
If you find an Issue you think you can fix, leave a
comment and let the project know you're interested, asking any questions you
might have. Pick small bugs to work on so you don't get overwhelmed.

Try not to work on Issues that other people are doing. If you find an Issue
that has someone else assigned, but hasn't been updated in a while, you can
leave a comment asking them (i.e., @ mention their name) if you can take it
over. Be polite, be considerate, but also don't be afraid to get involved.

NOTE: you might end up working on more Issues than Pull Requests (e.g., you
might start one, and decide it's not right for you). That's OK. Be aware
that only Pull Requests count toward your 5-PRs.

For Pull Requests, make sure you follow the contribution guidelines of each project, run
tests locally before you submit, follow style guidelines, etc. Be
professional with your submissions, and put some care into them.

If you are unsure about aspects of your Pull Request, make sure you leave
comments and questions as well. Finally, be responsive to feedback and
update your code as asked by reviewers.

You should be working on at least 1 Pull Request each week. You will
end up with **5 Pull Requests** by the end of October.

### Blog Posts

Talk about the Issues and Pull Requests you're working on, the code you're
learning, the projects you're getting involve with, etc.

Be specific and use links to your work, screenshots, or other material
to help tell your story. What are you learning? What surprised you?
Who helped you out? What are you learning about open source?

Each week you need to post something to your blog and add a link.
In total you will have **5 blog posts** by the end of October.

## Getting Help

While each student must complete their own Pull Requests, you are not alone.
You can and should help one another, and there are a number of ways to do this.

Please use our [course's Slack instance](https://seneca-open-source.slack.com) to discuss your work with other classmates.

You can also [file an Issue in this repo](https://github.com/humphd/hacktoberfest-at-seneca-2018/issues/new) if you are really stuck on something
and want to get the attention of others in the class. Use the
[hacktoberfest-help](https://github.com/humphd/hacktoberfest-at-seneca-2018/labels/hacktoberfest-help) label. You are encouraged to [watch this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/#watching-a-single-repository) so you see when there are new Issues or updates.

Finally, be sure to reach out to the projects to which you are contributing.
You can ask questions in your Issue or Pull Request, and many projects will
also have a Slack instance, mailing list, etc. where you can talk to the
developers directly.
